Known Issues - Online Classifier

1. 	Unsafe string copy
	Microsoft implemented an own mechanism to check whether std::string copies are correctly done (no buffer overflow,...). The boost library uses other mechanisms to copy std::strings, so the msvc compiler throws a warning. To disable this warning add the flag -D_SCL_SECURE_NO_WARNINGS under Properties -> Configuration -> C/C++ -> Command Line -> additional options (Microsoft Visual Studio 2013).
	A more detailed description is available under http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12270224/xutility2227-warning-c4996-std-copy-impl
	
2.	Shutdown takes a lot of time
	It takes the tripple time of defined maximal waiting time of the BlockingQueue to shut down the Classifier. I do not know why this is so, but this is only a minor issue. You just have to wait some seconds longer until all threads are finally stoped.
	
3.	Unsafe function or variable
	libsvm-3.18 uses the function some functions that are not in the C++ standard. Therefore MSVC throws the warning 'C4996'. To disable this warnign add 
		#pragma warning(disable : 4996)
	to the beginning of svm.h.
	
4.	Training the SVMs creates output
	The svm_train() function of libsvm prints configuration information to the console. To disable/enable this, set the value of
		#if 1
		static void info(const char *fmt,...)
	to '0';
