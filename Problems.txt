Known Issues - Online Classifier

1. 	Unsafe string copy
	Microsoft implemented an own mechanism to check whether std::string copies are correctly done (no buffer overflow,...). The boost library uses other mechanisms to copy std::strings, so the
	msvc compiler throws a warning. To disable this warning add the flag -D_SCL_SECURE_NO_WARNINGS under Properties -> Configuration -> C/C++ -> Command Line -> additional options (Microsoft Visual Studio 2013).
	A more detailed description is available under http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12270224/xutility2227-warning-c4996-std-copy-impl
	
2.	Shutdown takes a lot of time
	It takes the tripple time of defined maximal waiting time of the BlockingQueue to shut down the Classifier. I do not know why this is so, but this is only a minor issue. You just have to wait some seconds longer until all threads are finally stoped.
